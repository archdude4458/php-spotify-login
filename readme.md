php-spotify-login
=================

A simple script, 40 lines of simple, to login to spotify. Reason for the script is simple, to automate UK logins for non UK residents. Get a UK shell and set up a cronjob for weekly and this should stop people from having to get someone from the UK to login for them constantly.
